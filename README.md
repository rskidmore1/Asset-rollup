Asset Rollup counts the number of Active and Assigned Assets on Accounts and puts the number of each kind into a field in the Account. AR Uses Batch Apex to query and update every Account in the SFDC Org and is run once a day to update record changes from the previous day. 



AR replaces a SFDC App that was no longer working.
